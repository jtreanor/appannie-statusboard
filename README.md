#AppAnnie Statistics For Status Board

This is a simple Sinatra app which allows any users of AppAnnie to add graphs of app downloads to their Panic status board.

A deployed version is available here: https://appannie.herokuapp.com/.

Due to the sensitive nature of these credentials I encourage you to deploy your own instance of this. I highly recommend Heroku for this.

This is a work in progress.

##Setup

1. On your iPad, fill out the form with your AppAnnie credentials and the desired time period.
2. Tap the button to add it directly to your status board. 
3. Enjoy! :)
