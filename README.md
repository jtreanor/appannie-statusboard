#AppAnnie Statistics For Status Board

This is a simple Sinatra app which allows any users of AppAnnie to add graphs of app downloads to their Panic status board.

A deployed version is available here: (https://app-stat.eu01.aws.af.cm/)[https://app-stat.eu01.aws.af.cm/].

Due to the sensitive nature of these credentials I encourage you to deploy your own instance of this. I highly recommend AppFog for this.

This is a work in progress.
